# Sometimes youâ€™ll want to create a list of items that cannot change.
# Python refers to values that cannot change as immutable, and an immutable
# list is called a tuple.
dimensions = (200, 50)
print(dimensions[0])
print(dimensions[1])
# Tuples are technically defined by the presence of a comma; the parentheses
# make them look neater and more readable. If you want to define a tuple with
# one element, you need to include a trailing comma:
my_tuple = 3,  # Notice the lack of parenthesis
# It does not often make sense to build a tuple with one element, but this
# can happen when tuples are generated automatically.
print(my_tuple[0])
print(my_tuple)
# You can loop over all the values in a tuple using a for loop,
# just as you did with a list:
for dimension in dimensions:
    print(dimension)

print("\nOriginal dimensions:")
for dimension in dimensions:
    print(dimension)
dimensions = (400, 100)  # Redefining the tuple works however,
# dimensions[0] = 250 would not work as tuples are not changeable
print("\nModified dimensions:")
for dimension in dimensions:
    print(dimension)
# When compared with lists, tuples are simple data structures. Use them
# when you want to store a set of values that should not be changed
# throughout the life of a program.
